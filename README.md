# Rest Over WS | Springboot starter
ROW (Rest Over Websocket) | Spring boot websocket that wrapps rest apis

## Description
As the name suggests, ROW creates an websocket endpoint and provides json based protocol that wraps springboot rest controllers. Therefore, with a simple configuration and some annotations, your application will be served on websocket alongside already defined http endpoints.


## TODO

- [ ] Filter chain for request handling (So developers can inject their own filters)
- [ ] Session authentication to work with `@PreAuthorize`
