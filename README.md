# Rest Over Websocket | Springboot starter
ROW (Rest Over Websocket) | Spring boot websocket that wrapps rest apis

## Description
As the name suggests, ROW creates a websocket endpoint and provides json based protocol that wraps springboot rest controllers. Therefore, with a simple configuration and some annotations, your application will be served on websocket alongside already defined http endpoints.

## Documentations
Everything you need to know is covered in [wiki pages](https://github.com/idioglossia/spring-rest-over-ws/wiki).

## Demo
A demo of this project is available [here](https://github.com/idioglossia/row-demo). This demo uses [Java Row Client](https://github.com/idioglossia/java-row-client) as client to contact row server.

## TODO

- [ ] Added handler pipeline for row scanner (cleaner code)
- [ ] Added application events for row configurations
- [ ] Customizable error handler
